                    <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                    <P>Elephants are large mammals of the family Elephantidae and order proboscidea. Two are traditonally recognised, the African elephant(Loxodota africana) and the Asian elephant(Elephans maximus), although some evidence suggest that African bush elephants and African forest elephants are separate species (L. africana and L. cyclotis respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include deinotheris, gomphotheres, mammoths, and mastodons. Male African elephants are the largest extant terrestrial animals and can reach a height of 4m (13 ft) and weigh 7,000 kg (15,000 1b).</P>
                    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notible of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particulary breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
                    <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including savannas, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
